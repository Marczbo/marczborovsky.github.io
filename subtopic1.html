                    This article talks about AI and predictive maintenance in nuclear power plants to prevent equipment failures.
                    The nuclear plant of the future operates under mountains of information from sensors, gauges, pumps and even
                    cooling systems, but small incremental deviations are difficult for the tracking windows to notice. Yet AI models
                    can continuously assess these streams, pick up patterns that are transparent to the eye, and holistically
                    investigate deviations from unexpected behavior before anything deemed catastrophic occurs. The site offers a few
                    examples of machine-learning tools used to assess temperature, pressure and vibration levels in the safety
                    injection, reactor coolant, emergency diesel generators and containment systems before discussing how predictive
                    analytics result in less downtime, longer aged equipment life spans and decreased total maintenance costs.
                    In addition, the site acknowledges that safety comes first and this early detection is able to avoid any failures
                    that could compound into worse situations for those working in a nuclear setting. This is a solid site because it
                    discusses the why behind predictive maintenance AI and how it's crucial for these modernized operational approaches.

                    This is a journal article from the Idaho National Laboratory. This explores new discoveries from computer
                    scientists and computer engineers in the artificial intelligence field. Since AI plays a part in systems level
                    monitoring and reliability, this topic is highly connected to the INL organizational purpose. For example, much
                    of the legacy nuclear fleet operates on analog instrumentation; therefore, less data readily available and
                    performance indicators harder to assess. AI assists in legacy digitization reading in instrumentation and
                    performance degradation/unusual operation performance indicators (yellow flags, red flags). This journal article
                    connects to trained machine learning models in parameter detection from precursory data obtained in plants so
                    operators understand abnormal behavior before they see (or feel) anything. INL AI research pertaining to this is
                    improved inspection AI through robotics and enhanced automated data management for safe (and effective)
                    operations. Ultimately, this journal article champions that AI should not take over operator jobs, but facilitate
                    teams knowing failures could happen before they actually do because system degradation happens. This is an extra
                    component for operational predictions and maintenance accuracy for the most efficient understanding of complex
                    systems. This is a trustworthy source for additional insight into the applied research of the American nuclear
                    industry.
