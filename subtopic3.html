                    This article delves into how AI is dominating the efforts of efficiency and performance improvement within
                    nuclear power plants as of late. It observes that AI plays a role in supporting digital-twin systems, the virtual
                    mapping of each reactor's virtual twin, allowing engineers to simulate action and testing energy production
                    without interfering with the actual day-to-day developments in the plant. Moreover, it discusses how AI helps
                    determine sensor-derived data that can improve fuel placement and evaluation in the plant and subsequently,
                    refined control-room response with better thermal performance and comprehension. It continues by saying that the
                    AI link is important because such algorithms can take the massive amounts of data and collate it in ways that
                    better visualize what's not comprehensible by operators while working at a reactor. This reduces excess and
                    increases efficiency and productivity. This also increases safety, as AI technology provides a more solidified
                    edge to situational awareness. Therefore, AI will assist in taking over the next generation of these systems -
                    especially small modular reactors that require such operational automation and data-dependent needs.

                    This peer-reviewed scientific review is from the last five years and covers recent developments in artificial
                    intelligence applications for nuclear industry efficiency, optimization and decision-making. The review from the
                    article notes AI applications and techniques - from machine learning and neural networks to evolutionary
                    algorithms - that help model reactors, predict fuel burnup and optimize core designs. AI applications comprehend
                    sub-second radiation and thermal-hydraulic data that would otherwise require extensive human computations. The
                    more AI can help in scheduling, accident predictive analytics and multidisciplinary performance within systems
                    the more nuclear plants can operate more easily with less operating costs. Additionally, the review notes relevant
                    case studies that validate findings of AI in reactor modeling, fault prediction for scheduling and maintenance
                    and reduced human error via improved diagnostics. The authors assume that AI will revolutionize nuclear
                    engineering in the coming years with improved control strategies that allow for less uncertainty and more
                    knowledge from findings due to quicker responses from large sets of data to previously impossible response times.
                    This information will substantiate the need for academic contribution to AI's role in plant optimization.
