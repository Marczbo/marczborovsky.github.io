                    The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission's site explains how the U.S. NRC is preparing for AI developments in
                    nuclear facilities across the nation. It explains the agency's established "Principles of Good Regulation" and
                    how AI will be evaluated for safety, transparency and reliability. It notes various regulatory concerns -
                    explainability, security and compliance with federal safety regulations - that must be maintained even if AI makes
                    such decisions. In addition, cybersecurity is a major factor since AI introduces vulnerabilities that poorly
                    designed/unmonitored systems increase. The NRC explains real-time projects on AI, public workshops and an expert
                    forum to better understand the good and the bad of AI in nuclear reactors. Ultimately, this site conveys that
                    regulators must keep up with developments in the technology world and constantly shifting landscape but they also
                    must maintain strict safety enforcement.

                    This article supports the notion of AI security risks and regulations in systems/supply chains. It talks about
                    the benefits, naturally, of AI in systems - faster analysis, broader surveillance, better predictions - but then
                    the need to assess how the vulnerabilities weigh against them. It emphasizes the cyberattacks, data manipulation,
                    and interference to which AI is susceptible and how this impacts sensitive systems. It discusses how the AI
                    complication undermines models for transparent/trusted decision-making (nuclear safety/security). It also
                    explains how the presence of AI in nuclear facilities from previous systems means that only when AI comes into
                    play with recommendations do the need for governance criteria, upgraded cyber requirements, international
                    cooperation, and regulations-based systems approaches come into play. It even explains how supply chains will be
                    compromised if AI systems are not deployed securely. This article gets to the risks and regulations that would go
                    hand in hand with AI and nuclear systems.
